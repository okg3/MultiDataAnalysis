Description: This package facilitates combining data from multiple files, 
    experiments, or datasets into one analysis. In particular, this package 
    has two main functionalities: 1. Merging files that are split by sample 
    into one data set by experiment/measurement type, and 2. Applying a 
    regression model to all rows of one or more matrices using data from 
    multiple data sets.
