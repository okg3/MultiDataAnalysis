# MultiDataAnalysis
This package facilitates combining data from multiple files, experiments, or datasets into one analysis. In particular, this package has two main functionalities: 1. Merging files that are split by sample into one data set by experiment/measurement type, and 2. Applying a regression model to all rows of one or more matrices using data from multiple data sets.
